# Path Planning Algorithms Visualizer

This project demonstrates and compares classical path planning algorithms — **A\***, **Dijkstra**, **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** — on a 2D grid. It visualizes the path generated by each algorithm and compares them based on execution time and path length.
